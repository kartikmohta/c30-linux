1. Run configure:
      ./configure [installdir]
   If you don't specify installdir, the default '/usr/local/pic30' will be used.
   The patches will also be applied.

2. Run make:
      make
   This will compile binutils and gcc.

3. Run make install:
      sudo make install
   This installs binutils and gcc to the specified '<installdir>'.

   If the 'pic30-nonfree' directory is not empty, it will be copied to
   '<installdir>/pic30-nonfree'.

   The non-free components by Microchip cannot be distributed here due to
   licensing conditions.

   The 'pic30-nonfree' directory should contain the following items from a
   C30 Windows installation in order to get a working compiler:

   pic30-nonfree
   |
   +- bin
   |  |
   |  +- c30_device.info
   |  +- device_files
   |
   +- include
   +- lib
   +- support

To install the non-free components separately, run
   make nonfree

To clean up the source tree and configuration info, run
   make clean
